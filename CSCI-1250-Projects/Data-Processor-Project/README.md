# Course & Temperature Data Processor
A Python project created as part of the **CSCI 1250 course**. This program demonstrates code reuse by processing two different types of data: course enrollment numbers and daily temperature readings. It calculates totals, averages, and prints a summary report.

## Features
- Process enrollment numbers for multiple courses.
- Calculate total students enrolled across courses.
- Calculate average class size.
- Process daily temperature readings.
- Calculate total and average temperature.
- Demonstrates code reuse with pattern functions (`calculate_total` and `calculate_average`).
- Provides a summary report combining all data.

## Installation
1. Clone the main repository:
git clone https://github.com/BurakBaskir/CSCI-1250-Projects.git
2. Navigate to this project folder:
cd CSCI-1250-Projects/Data-Processor-Project
3. Run the program (requires Python 3.x):
python data_processor_burak_baskir.py

## Usage
- The program will prompt you to enter enrollment numbers for three courses:
Enter CSCI 1250 enrollment: 30
Enter CSCI 1100 enrollment: 25
Enter CSCI 2400 enrollment: 40

- Then it will prompt for daily temperatures:
Enter Monday temperature: 72.5
Enter Tuesday temperature: 75.0
Enter Wednesday temperature: 70.0

- Output includes total students, average class size, total and average temperature:
Total students across all courses: 95
Average class size: 31.7
Average temperature: 72.5Â°F

## Reference / Inspiration
This project was inspired by the [CSCI 1250 class resources](https://github.com/CSCI-1250/class_resources_public) provided by Professor Ryan Haas.
