# CSCI-1250 Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my freshman year at **East Tennessee State University** as part of the **CSCI 1250 - Introduction to Computer Science** course instructed by Professor Ryan Haas.  

These projects represent my first steps in learning programming and applying computational thinking to solve problems. Each project is contained in its own dedicated folder and is independent of the others.

## Repository Structure
```
CSCI-1250-Projects/
│
├── Academic-Advisor_Project/
├── Data-Processor-Project/
├── [Other projects...]
```
- Each folder corresponds to a single project.
- Projects may be implemented in **Python** or may require specific tools depending on their purpose.
- Instructions for running and understanding a project can be found inside each project’s own folder (usually in its `README.md`).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate:
- My progress in coding during my freshman year.  
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking through small, practical projects.  
- The foundation of my computer science journey, starting with CSCI 1250.  

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/BurakBaskir/CSCI-1250-Projects.git

2. Navigate into the repository:
cd CSCI-1250-Projects

3. Select a project folder, review its README.md, and follow the instructions provided there to run the project.

Example:
Academic-Advisor_Project

 Then follow the project-specific instructions.
